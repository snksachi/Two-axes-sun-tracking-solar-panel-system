# Two-axes-sun-tracking-solar-panel-system
The proposed prototype is based on a dual-axis solar tracker controlled with Arduino nano which is an open-source prototyping platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. The solar tracker can be controlled automatically with the help of Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensors
